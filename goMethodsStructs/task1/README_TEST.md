# Testing Go Functions With Console Output

## The Challenge with Testing Output Functions

The function mostly performs console output operations - it prints text to the console. This is inherently hard to test in a traditional way because we can't easily capture and verify the output in an automated test.

So instead, we're really just trying to make sure the function runs completely without crashing. That's why we've structured this test to catch panics.

## Our Testing Approach

Here's what we're doing:

1. We want to run our example function
2. We want to know if it crashes (panics)
3. We need a way to catch any potential panic and report it as a test failure

The trick is that in Go, when a function panics, it immediately stops execution and starts unwinding the stack. The only way to catch a panic is with `recover()`, which must be called from a deferred function.

So we create an anonymous function wrapper, set up a deferred panic handler inside it, and then call our real function. If anything goes wrong, the panic gets caught, and we fail the test.

If nothing goes wrong (which is what we expect), the function completes normally, the deferred function runs but `recover()` returns nil (since there was no panic), and the test passes.

It's basically a safety net - we're not testing specific behavior beyond "it doesn't crash," but that's still valuable information, especially for example code that someone might copy and use.
